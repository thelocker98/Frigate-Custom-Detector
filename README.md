# AI-powered image classification system for detecting when packages are delivered.
I will create an AI model to detect delivery trucks that park in front of my house to see if I am getting a package delivered. I will be able to look at the color of the vehicle and also the logos to figure out if it is Amazon, FedEx, UPS, or USPS.
